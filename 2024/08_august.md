Been doing water changes almost daily and the tank looks a lot nicer. I also bought some Java Fern and some large-ish Amazon Swords to consume the extra nutrients in the aquarium column - it seems to be doing the trick!

I reduced the amount of white sand and covered with [Tropica Aquarium Soil Powder](https://tropica.com/en/plant-care/aquarium-soil/aquarium-soil/) - both fine and coarse versions. I like it but not sure how it will turn out yet as it broke my original design and now I'm in no man's land - still I planted some monte carlos (MC) and hope it will spread nicely.

I turned the CO2 and the lights back on, dosing fertilizers very seldomly. Got a phosphate and Fe test kit.

The phosphate test kit is actually quite nice: it's from API but the color is a lot easier to distinguish. I'm color blind and the fact that the whole vial turns an opaque color makes it a lot easier to distinguish against the chart. I'm not sure if the new test kits from API are like that too but it's nice to see that somebody is looking after us color blind people.

I also noticed the the right back section of the tank had basically still water: that's where the filter intake is and I noticed basically zero movement so I put a water pump in there and hooked up a duck bill to get some wider water movement and it seems to be doing the trick.

Finally I got a [little basket from IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/fanggroeda-insert-with-compartments-light-grey-90559526/) which is helping keeping underneath my tank nice and tidy. Plus a few [LED lights (abou 60 lumens each)](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/kapplake-led-spotlight-white-20543157/) that connect to USB power: really like those as they allow me to see at night or during dawn/dusk times - quite bright for their size!

Did an 80% water change and it helped with the cloudiness. The plants are actually growing so not all hope is lost but I think I might change the intake position.

The wood I'm using looks great but I think it might be blocking the flow of water into the filter somehow, not allow for all the particles in the water from being absorbed. My tank is rather long and short and maybe that is causing issues... I'll play a bit and see how it goes.

Will likely do a water change again on Saturday or Sunday but for now things are looking OK.

So I stopped asking questions - and spending money - at my LFS and decided to let things roll. It turns out that my water turned black and almost no light comes in and after asking around in forums - thank you Reddit - it looks like I have a "bio bloom" which is essentially a lack of beneficial bacteria resulting in an imbalance where the bad bacteria simply thrives.

The good news is that it will eventually go away. The bad news is that it will take time and I might lose some plants - however, on that note, some of my MC is actually developing and I can see some new growth on other plants too so not all hope is lost.

Yesterday - Sunday, Aug 18th - I did a 20% water change, readjusted my CO2, reduced my light time and add more biomedia to my canister filter. I also added another layer of fine wool to help with the filtration but I guess unless the bio bloom go away it won't help filter many things out. It's a shame to see so many BBA growing though, I might have to take some elements out and clear them but that's for later. I also measured the GH/KH yesterday and GH is 6 and KH is 3: definitely can improve on the GH front.

Finally since I can't buy pure ammonia here in Australia I decided to use the fish food method and drop a considerable amount on the water every morning so my nitrogen cycle doesn't break.

Ah and I did two other things:

1. Bought an air stone and put it in the tank; that should help with aeration
2. I removed the Dymax Clear Mix to renew it. That means:

    - Soak in 1:1 parts bleach and water for 24 hours
    - Let is soak in tank water for another 24 hours with a double dose of water conditioner on it

I'm currently halfway through the first step so I might be able to put it back on the tank on Wednesday. Said that I will wait until the tank is fully cycled and keep it in a ziplock bag for now so it doesn't dry out.

Right now it's a wait game. I won't be doing much throughout the week, only a water change on Saturday or Sunday morning but let's allow the ecosystem do its thing and then hopefully things will get into a situation where things clear up and all plants are happy and levels stabilize and everyone is happy - especially me!

Got a new light to complement the other one. I was doing some calculations and looks like I do not have enough lumens: according to [my spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IrqIBygd8MKEA3pOYLY1BDArz8S-sklm/edit?gid=811352064#gid=811352064) I only have enough for a low lit tank. Plus the position of my driftwood doesn't allow me to use my current light in the middle of the tank which is a bummer so my setup now looks like below:

I have also measured my levels but quite frankly it's hard: I can't see colors very well and for as much as I trust my family to tell me what color it is I find it hard to constantly monitor and so on.

My CO2 measure is telling me that I either have enough or too much CO2. Even after a 30% water change things are kinda the same so I'm either doing something wrong or maybe the plants are not absorbing as much as needed and I'm ending up with excess CO2.

Hence after dosing it very midly with Fe, P and N I decided to let things run their course. I'll continue to dose during the week and monitor things here and there but nature must run its course.

On the plus side the Dymax product is working and the tannin is cleaning up. I believe I might lose a few plants though but I guess it's the price you pay.

- Plant leaves started showing some decay and some algae are starting to bloom - plants lack nutrients. Got the following supplements from the fish shop:
  - Iron
  - Phosphate
  - Nitrogen

Also got KH/GH/CO2 tests to ensure my levels are OK. Also got a product called [Dymax Clear Mix](https://mydymax.com/products/dymax-clear-mix?_pos=1&_sid=a1a01caa8&_ss=r) which can absorb the impurities - have to put it under the fine wool so I'm yet to do that.

Did a water change (only about 10/15%) and that cleared things up a bit.

The CO2 measure is in the water and looks green enough, I guess I have enough CO2 but I'm thinking of lowering the light a bit more for the plants to benefit from it. We'll see.

All nutrients from plants are from `aquavitro`:

- [propel (Fe)](https://www.aquavitro.com/propel.php)
- [activate (P)](https://www.aquavitro.com/activate.php)
- [synthesis (N)](https://www.aquavitro.com/synthesis.php)

Which I fed:

- `Fe` -> 5 mL
- `P` -> 3 mL
- `N` -> 3 mL

- Planted Blyxa Japonicas, Crypts, Anubias and Banana Lily (plus another one I don't remember)
- Had to get an O-ring for my CO2 solenoid as the one I had dried out
- Hooked it all up and put
  - a bit of tap conditioner
  - a bit of fluoride

Tank water is green/brown which is quite unpleasant. Probably due to driftwood. It will clear up but need time.

Setup the light schedule to be two sessions of 3 hours.
