Did a 20% water change today and parameters looked good to add some fish to start consuming the algae that formed during the early days. It's been 3 weeks now and the plants are growing, tank is stabilising and things look much better: there's still some tanin on the water from the driftwood but I guess that will persist. I spoke to my LFS and one of their tanks is using about 1L of Purigen and even then things are still kinda brownish but super clear; sometimes you can't avoid it and you know what? I kinda like it.

My bacteria bloom is mostly controlled: I gotta take care of the amount of nutrients I add to the water. Yesterday I did an 80% water change and added iron and a nitrogen mixture and things got a bit darker afterwards. I guess just add something every few days and we should be OK. There is still some phosphate in the water - ideally I'd like to keep this down to zero - and iron is a bit funny, can't get a proper reading However most plants look healthy, especially the ones growing outside the tank.

I added four common Bristlenose to help with the algae and finish the cycle. I also have about a few snails there which is a bit concerning but I'll deal with them later on.
