Introduced more fish: leopard danios (with an extra zebra danio in the mix), electric blue cichlid and some glass shrimps. The tank looks so pretty!

I tested the parameters yesterday and got the following:

- PH: ~ 6.6
- Ammonia: 0
- Nitrite: 0
- Nitrate: 0
- Phosphate: 0.25 ppm
- GH: 4
- KH: 2
- Iron: 0.1 ppm

I guess it looks alright: the plants are growing, the fish seem happy, not sure if I lost any bristlenose yet as I can only see two and I have a very dark part of my tank that maybe they like it there... not sure.

Regardless I'm not touching the water for a week and will try to do a water change only next Saturday.

I noticed that there are some dots on the glass. They seem like algae so I guess that's OK as I just scrape them and it gets cleaned up for a couple of days.

### About light

My current light exposure is about 6 hours and 40 minutes and I have about 70 watts of light (~ 5000 lumens) coming through: both of them are LED it's just that one is a long one that sits at the front of the tank and the other is kinda of a focus light at the back (it spreads well but not as well as I want it.)

Most people I spoke with seem to believe that this is too much light but because of the driftwood I can't get the light setup in the middle of the tank so I thought I need something to complement the back.

Right now though I'm considering getting the [Fluval Plant 46W](https://amzn.asia/d/2BbBDUk) and hang it in the middle but I'm not convinced it will get me enough lumens yet hence if I find something more powerful I might consider it, not sure yet.

But... that's a problem for later. I'm quite happy right now.

## 2024-09-01

Did a 20% water change today and parameters looked good to add some fish to start consuming the algae that formed during the early days. It's been 3 weeks now and the plants are growing, tank is stabilising and things look much better: there's still some tanin on the water from the driftwood but I guess that will persist. I spoke to my LFS and one of their tanks is using about 1L of Purigen and even then things are still kinda brownish but super clear; sometimes you can't avoid it and you know what? I kinda like it.

My bacteria bloom is mostly controlled: I gotta take care of the amount of nutrients I add to the water. Yesterday I did an 80% water change and added iron and a nitrogen mixture and things got a bit darker afterwards. I guess just add something every few days and we should be OK. There is still some phosphate in the water - ideally I'd like to keep this down to zero - and iron is a bit funny, can't get a proper reading However most plants look healthy, especially the ones growing outside the tank.

I added four common Bristlenose to help with the algae and finish the cycle. I also have about a few snails there which is a bit concerning but I'll deal with them later on.
